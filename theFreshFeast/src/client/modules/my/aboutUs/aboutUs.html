        <p class="aboutus">First opening the Haddam, CT location in June 2001,
            The Cooking Company’s owner and creator Sue wanted to share her passion
            for food with her shoreline neighbors. Throughout her life, she had always
            wanted to be a chef and decided that opening The Cooking Company was the
            right step to developing her own recipes with fresh and in season ingredients.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutus">After great demand, Sue opened The Cooking Company’s next
              location in Killingworth. Both locations are unique and popular spots for
              to-go lunches, dinners, desserts and catering. The Cooking Company has been
              recognized and awarded as one of the best take-out food markets along the shoreline.
              Every fresh prepared dish and item on the menu is available for take-out as well as casual dine-in. </p>
              <p class="aboutus">The Classic Menu is available every day, and the Daily Specials are always changing,
                so you never know what you might find here!</p>
