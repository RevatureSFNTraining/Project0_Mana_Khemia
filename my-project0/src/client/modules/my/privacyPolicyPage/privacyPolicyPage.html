        <p class="lineSpacing">The Federal Trade Commission warns users to be suspicious of any official-looking e-mail

            information based on the request of someone pretending to be a representative of Fantastictools.com.
            Instead, always log into your Account for information about your orders. If you need to contact us, please

        <p class="lineSpacing">If you receive suspicious email that purports to come from Fantastictools.com, you might
            have been the target of a "phishing" scam.</p>
        <p class="lineSpacing">Phishing (pronounced "fishing") is a common internet scam where a perpetrator sends out
            official looking emails that appear to come from the internet's biggest web sites in an illegal attempt to
            gather personal financial information from the recipient. Phishing is also called "carding" or "spoofing."
        </p>
        <p class="lineSpacing">Phishing scams may start out by trying to contact and confuse the victim with a phony
            order confirmation and then move on to collecting credit card information under the pretense of trying to
            clear up the victim's account.</p>
        <p class="lineSpacing">Phishers camouflage their emails by using actual company logos, similar email formats,
            and links to legitimate web pages hosted by the legitimate company.</p>
        <p class="lineSpacing">Phishing is a variation of the word fishing. It only takes one or two guileless victims
            to make it worth the while of the scam artist.</p>
        <p>If you suspect you have been phished, forward the e-mail to uce@ftc.gov or call the FTC help line,
            1-877-FTC-HELP.</p>
